INSTRUCTIONS


In order to get the project working correctly, take out all of the contents of this repository
and put them inside a folder inside the C:\xampp\htdocs folder. For example I called my folder
'jordanstown_theatre'.

Once everything is inside and Apache and MYSQL is turned on in the XAMPP Control Panel, type
the following into your web broswer.

localhost/(whatever you have called your folder containing everything)/

For example, I would type.

' http://localhost/jordanstown_theatre/ '

After you do that, a Login page should appear asking for Email and Password.

Here's a email and password so you can login.
